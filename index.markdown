I am a second-year PhD student at Technische Universit√§t Berlin, supervised by [Prof. Matthias Boehm](https://mboehm7.github.io). Prior to this, I was a PhD student at Prof. Hasso Plattner's [Enterprise Platform and Integration Concepts](https://hpi.de/plattner/home.html) (EPIC) chair at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam.
My research focusses on query optimization for analytical database systems and cloud-based data processing. 
Specifically, I am looking into adaptive query processing and robust plan generation to reduce the effects of erroneous cardinality estimates.
