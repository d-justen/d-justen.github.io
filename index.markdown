I am a second-year PhD student at Technische Universität Berlin, supervised by [Prof. Matthias Boehm](https://mboehm7.github.io) and member of the [BIFOLD](https://www.bifold.berlin) Graduate School. 
Prior to this, I was a PhD student at Prof. Hasso Plattner's [Enterprise Platform and Integration Concepts](https://hpi.de/plattner/home.html) (EPIC) chair at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam.
My research focusses on query optimization for analytical database systems and cloud-based data processing. 
Specifically, I am looking into adaptive query processing and robust plan generation to reduce the effects of erroneous cardinality estimates.

## Unrelated Interests

Besides my work as a researcher I am an active member of [TAMLI](https://tamli.de), a charitable organization that supervises young adults and delegates them to a voluntary service in a home for people with special needs in Israel. I am also a [part-time DJ](https://soundcloud.com/oshky) - so hit me up if you happen to know how to get a booking for Andy Pavlo's database courses.
