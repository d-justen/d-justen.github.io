I am currently a second-year PhD stundent at Technische Universität Berlin, supervised by Matthias Boehm. 
My research focusses on performance robustness for analytical data processing systems. 
Specifically, I am looking into adaptive strategies to reduce performance deteriorations from sub-optimal join orders.
